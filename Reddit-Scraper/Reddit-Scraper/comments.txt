b'Comment 1 >> 7298 : The story was about a dog named Indiana and an archeologist named Junior. '
b'Comment 2 >> 512 : If you watch the Spielberg documentary it says that no studio wanted to work with Spielberg because he was constantly over budget and after 1941 flopped that was the last straw. George Lucas said pitched the idea of Indy to him with the condition that if its good Spielberg has to direct a sequel. \n\nThe two of them went to a bunch of studios trying to sell the movie and a couple of them said yes, but with out Spielberg (which is crazy to think about now). George Lucas had to promise to keep the movie on time and on budget and that finally got Paramount to agree to let Spielberg direct. This revamped his career and its all thanks to Lucas and his idea for a B-movie style adventure movie'
b"Comment 3 >> 2704 : I always wondered how the pitch to sell the first movie went.\n\nOk I've got an idea, action movie staring a history professor, who also goes on adventures for lost artifacts.\n\nUmm ok, but\n\nNah I'm not finished, he also fights Nazis\n\nYeah but\n\nAnd he has a whip\n\nWhen do we start filming?"
b"Comment 4 >> 2770 : Man, the original Indiana Jones trilogy were such huge favorites for my entire childhood.  I regularly/randomly just start whistling the theme to these movies too.  Not obnoxiously, but if I'm just working or doing something alone, and the notion to whistle comes up (as it does occasionally), I'm always just starting out with Indiana Jones.  Thank you Eon Productions, for turning down Spielberg. "
b'Comment 5 >> 1912 : George Lucas has amazing ideas as a writer and terrible ideas as a director.'
b"Comment 6 >> 339 : Later in the 90s, Spielberg went to Eon Productions again, wanting to direct a James Bond movie. They told him that they couldn't afford him now."

b'Comment 11 >> 22 : I have a buddy whose dad was an archaeologist and got Spielberg to change the setting of the beginning of The Last Crusade from a graveyard to out in Monument valley so as to not promote grave robbing.  '
b'Comment 12 >> 16 : Also  interesting, George "Lucas attempted to pitch his own Flash Gordon feature in the 1970s, but was unable to acquire the rights. Instead, he took some thematic and aesthetic cues from the series (including its opening title crawl), and synthesized them into his own sci-fi project, a film he tentatively called [The Star Wars."] (https://mashable.com/2016/04/15/flash-gordon/#V.eyK.oYPsqR)\n'

b"Comment 19 >> 11 : I loved reading the transcript of the Raiders of the Lost Ark story conference ([PDF link](http://maddogmovies.com/almost/scripts/raidersstoryconference1978.pdf)), in which George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Larry Kasdan sit down and work out the details of the story together.\n\nIt's fascinating being a fly on the wall as one of the most iconic movies of all time takes shape before your eyes (though fair warning: you learn something very suspect about Indiana Jones that you can never unlearn)."
b'Comment 20 >> 14 : So what was the movie?'
b'Comment 21 >> 29 : If 007 has never existed, I\xe2\x80\x99d be the same person I am today, if Indiana Jones had never existed, I might have never become a man.'
b'Comment 22 >> 12 : What Lucas didn\'t tell Spielberg that he stole all of his ideas for the archaeologist named Indiana from a classic movie called ["Secrets of the Incas"] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20TAGRElvfE) starring Charlton Heston.\nWatch it for yourself and tell me Lucas didn\'t steal from this film: everything from the way the Heston\'s character dresses to the search for the gold "sunburst" and down to the missing piece that he has that he lines up with the light to locate the precise location of the object.'
b"Comment 23 >> 1511 : Says it was 11 houses from a specific broker. Looks like he bought close to a thousand homes, personally would need to see more evidence of intent or larger trend before chalking this up as more than random chance. Its crazy though that properties can be listed as owned/registered/obfuscated under shell companies, you'd think the actual owners would be public record. Dude owned close to 1000 houses across the US and no one knew about it."

b"Comment 25 >> 310 : I'm no fan of his by this headline was a bit misleading. His link is he bought property from the guy who did the wrong thing. If it turns out he did know they were gotten illegal, that would be a different story, but as it reads now he had no knowledge of wrongdoing. I assume if there were proof otherwise it woukd be in the article.\n\n"

b'Comment 27 >> 246 : Who would have possibly thought an associate of Donald Trump would be corrupt?'
b'Comment 28 >> 62 : So Hannity did business in 2012 with someone convicted of a crime in 2016. \n\n\nWas he supposed to know about the crimes? How? The government didn\xe2\x80\x99t from 2007 to 2012. \n\nIt also sounds like the purchase was through an intermediary. \n\n\nWhy/How is this even a story?'
b'Comment 29 >> 72 : Hannity is always knee deep in scum yet acts like the holy man... He is a piece of shit.'
b"Comment 30 >> 19 : I'm not seeing anything fraudulent about Sean Hannitys actions. Most real estate ventures via LLCs tend to be syndication (pools of capital run by operators doing the work). Every once in a while an investor makes the mistake of investing with a bad operator... that doesn't mean the investor is a bad person.\n\nAre we trying to make this guy look bad just because he's wealthy or because he's a fox news guy?"
b"Comment 31 >> 20 : I hate to say this because it will sound like I am somehow defending this: but it sounds like this is actually a problem with the auction process (which is a bigger deal as I will explain in a moment).\n\nIf houses are being sold for under-value it ultimately hurts the home owners in that community by driving up lending costs (and if they are recourse mortgages it drives the owners into debt that is unjust).  For a home to be sold at auction every effort should be made to ensure fair market value is achieved for that property.\n\nHere, it sounds like there were just 3 guys who did most of the buying at these auctions and of course they are going to realize that not bidding against each other is a good thing for them.  Hell their only real crime here was reaching a formal agreement about it.  Had they just organically taken turns bidding on houses they wouldn't have broken any law.  It is hard to imagine this not happening eventually if there are a few big buyers and not much other interest."

It's so hard to watch because he probably wont win and no one knows who the real dad is not even the mom :("
b"Comment 221 >> 4051 : As the child in this situation, I understand that pain.

DNA test confirmed. My father and mother were both devistated."
b"Comment 222 >> 3498 : Fun fact:\n\n\nLydia Fairchild is an American woman who exhibits chimerism, in having two distinct populations of DNA among the cells of her body. She was pregnant with her third child when she and the father of her children, Jamie Townsend, separated. When Fairchild applied for enforcement of child support in 2002, providing DNA evidence of Townsend's paternity was a routine requirement. While the results showed Townsend to be certainly their father, they seemed to rule out her being their mother.\n\n\nFairchild stood accused of fraud by either claiming benefits for other people's children, or taking part in a surrogacy scam, and records of her prior births were put similarly in doubt. Prosecutors called for her two children to be taken away from her.[dubious ] As time came for her to give birth to her third child, the judge ordered that an observer be present at the birth, ensure that blood samples were immediately taken from both the child and Fairchild, and be available to testify. Two weeks later, DNA tests seemed to indicate that she was also not the mother of that child.\n\n\nA breakthrough came when a lawyer for the prosecution[citation needed] knew of Karen Keegan, a chimeric woman in Boston, and suggested the similar possibility to Fairchild's lawyer, Alan Tindell, who then introduced an article in the New England Journal of Medicine about Keegan.[1][2] He realised that Fairchild's case might also be caused by chimerism. As in Keegan's case, DNA samples were taken from members of the extended family. The DNA of Fairchild's children matched that of Fairchild's mother to the extent expected of a grandmother. They also found that, although the DNA in Fairchild's skin and hair did not match her children's, the DNA from a cervical smear test did match. Fairchild was carrying two different sets of DNA, the defining characteristic of chimerism.\n\n\n(Copied from Wikipedia.)"
b"Comment 223 >> 871 : Happened to a friend of mine a couple years ago. Raised the kid for two years, she broke it off and sued for child support. Paternity test came back negative. He was devastated. He loved that kid and now had absolutely no parental rights anymore.\n\nShe went on to name three other guys, all negative. Meaning that while they were dating, she slept with him and at least those three guys during a single month. She still has no idea who the father is. I feel bad for him, but he's gotten on with life so I'm happy too."

b'Comment 227 >> 293 : My husband has had a rough, complicated history with his ex-wife, the biomom of his kids. He was pretty young when they got divorced, and he got screwed pretty badly on child support and division of property. He never missed a payment, even when it was a choice between paying his bills or paying his child support. He did what he could, worked hard, earned experience, and slowly moved up the ladder. \n\n10+ years later, we learned that there\xe2\x80\x99s a possibility that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t faithful to him while they were married. One of the kids looks exactly like him, one looks exactly like her, but one of them doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look at all like either of them. I asked him what he would do if he found out that any of his kids weren\xe2\x80\x99t biologically his. \n\nHe replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.

Just curious because I'd seek major compensation back as that would be such a traumatic and depressing thing to go through as the whole relationship is built on a lie.

b"Comment 239 >> 34 : Fucking another guy: bad.\nGetting pregnant and lying about paternity: Unforgivable.\n\nI always hear women in general have more empathy. Well, then apply the damn thing and imagine how it would feel being lied to about being a parent.\n\nAlso the time, energy and money. All something you could have spend on a child of your own. Maybe you wont even ever get to have a child of your own because of this betrayal.\n\nI hear people say paternity doesn't matter. Well, that's not for the woman to decide. Tell the man.
