"SEC. 51A-1.108_2","(b)   Purpose.  The purpose of this comprehensive plan is to promote sound development of the city and promote the public health, safety, and welfare.  The comprehensive plan is a plan for the long-range development of the city.  The comprehensive plan sets forth policies to govern the future physical development of the city.  The comprehensive plan shall serve as a guide to all future city council action concerning land use and development regulations, urban conservation and rehabilitation programs, and expenditures for capital improvements."
"SEC. 51A-1.108_3","(c)   Components.  The comprehensive plan is composed of the following components:"
"SEC. 51A-1.108_3_1","(1)   Vision component.  This component expresses the ideas, ideals, and goals residents have for the future of the city, and includes a vision illustration showing possible general locations of building blocks or development patterns."

"SEC. 51A-1.108_3_3","(3)   Implementation plan.  This plan provides timelines for accomplishing goals outlined in the vision statement and policy plan.  Goals are divided into the implementation plan, which are long-term projects, and action plans, which are short-term projects."

"SEC. 51A-1.108_4_2","(2)   The implementation plan and monitoring program may be amended by ordinance of the city council."
"SEC. 51A-1.108_5","(e)   Relation to zoning.  The relationship between the comprehensive plan and development regulations is that the comprehensive plan serves merely as a guide for rezoning requests rather than as a mandatory restriction on the city’s authority to regulate land use.  The comprehensive plan shall not constitute zoning regulations or establish zoning district boundaries.  The comprehensive plan does not limit the ability of the city to prepare other plans, policies, or strategies as required.  (Ord. Nos. 26371; 28073)"

"SEC. 51A-1.109_4_4","(4)   The director shall notify the developer of the apportionment determination within 60 days after deeming the developer report complete, prior to approval of any related zoning district classification or boundary change, prior to final release of any related plat, or prior to execution of any related private development contract, whichever is earliest."
