These districts are medium density districts and are located in certain areas close into the center of the city and at various outlying locations.  The area regulations are designed to protect the residential character and to prevent the overcrowding of the land by providing minimum standards for building spacing, yards, off-street parking, and coverage.  All commercial and office uses are prohibited.  It is anticipated that additional areas may be designated in the MF-2(A) or MF-2(SAH) district from time to time in the future where the change is appropriate and access and utility services can reasonably accommodate these medium density dwellings.  Additionally, the MF-2(SAH) district is created to encourage the provision of affordable housing."

Single or multiple uses may be developed on one site in a mixed use district as in any other district; however, in order to encourage a mixture of uses and promote innovative and energy conscious design, efficient circulation systems, the conservation of land, and the minimization of vehicular travel, density bonuses are awarded to developments that qualify as “mixed use projects” as defined in Subsection (b).  If a development does not qualify as an MUP, it is limited to a “base” dwelling unit density and floor area ratio.  When a development qualifies as an MUP, it earns a higher maximum dwelling unit density and floor area ratio and, in some instances, a greater maximum structure height.  Additional FAR bonuses are incrementally awarded to encourage the inclusion of “residential” as part of an MUP.  The exact increments of increase vary depending on the actual use categories mixed and the district that the MUP is in.  For more information regarding the exact increments of increase, consult the yard, lot, and space regulations in this section governing the particular district of interest."

The SUP requirement for a use in a district does not constitute an authorization or an assurance that the use will be permitted. Each SUP application must be evaluated as to its probable effect on the adjacent property and the community welfare and may be approved or denied as the findings indicate appropriate.

"SEC. 51A-4.219_3_1","(1)   As part of an SUP ordinance or ordinance amendment, the city council may declare that an SUP is eligible for automatic renewal pursuant to this subsection. Automatic renewal is an alternative to the standard method of renewing an SUP by amending the SUP ordinance. In order for automatic renewal to occur, the property owner or his representative must file a complete application for automatic renewal with the director after the 180th day but before the 120th day before the expiration of the current SUP time period. If a fee is required, the application is not considered “filed” until the fee is paid. For more information regarding fees, see Section 51A-1.105."

As part of the application, the property owner or his representative shall state that all existing SUP conditions have been complied with, and that no changes to the conditions or other SUP ordinance provisions are being requested."
"SEC. 51A-4.219_3_4","(4)   Failure to timely file a complete application required under Paragraph (1) renders the SUP ineligible for automatic renewal. The city council may, however, reinstate an SUP’s eligibility for future automatic renewals as part of a new SUP ordinance or ordinance amendment."
"SEC. 51A-4.219_3_5","(5)   Upon the filing of a complete application for automatic renewal, the director shall send written notice to all owners of real property lying within 200 feet of the area governed by the SUP. The notice must state that the SUP is eligible for automatic renewal and may be automatically renewed without further notice."
"SEC. 51A-4.219_3_6","(6)   If the owners of 20 percent or more of the land within 200 feet of the area governed by the SUP file a written protest against the automatic renewal in accordance with this paragraph, the director shall forward the application to the city plan commission and city council for further action. Written protests against an automatic renewal must be filed with the director before 5:00 p.m. of the 21st calendar day after the date the notice is mailed. A protest sent through the mail must be received by the director before the deadline. If the deadline falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or official city holiday, then the protests must be filed before noon of the following working day. To the extent that they do not conflict with this subsection, the provisions of Section 51A-4.701 governing written protests in zoning cases apply to protests filed under this subsection."
"SEC. 51A-4.219_3_7","(7)   After the deadline for filing written protests has passed, the director shall review the conditions of the SUP and determine whether the conditions have been met.

"SEC. 51A-4.219_3_10_1","(A)   the day following the next succeeding official agenda meeting of the city council after the council makes its final decision on the application; or"

Failure to timely file this application during any renewal period renders the SUP ineligible for further automatic renewal. The city council may, however, reinstate the SUP’s eligibility for future automatic renewals as part of a new SUP ordinance or ordinance amendment."

No permits to alter or demolish the property may be issued after provision of this notice until action is taken at that hearing by the city council, city plan commission, or landmark commission.  The historic designation procedure is considered to be initiated immediately when the city council, the city plan commission, or the landmark commission votes to initiate it or, in the case of initiation by the property owner(s), when the zoning change application is filed with the director."

Within 180 days after the filing of the appeal, the director shall prepare, and the landmark commission shall adopt, a designation report and submit it to the city council.  After submission of the designation report, the city council shall hold a public hearing on the appeal.  The sole issue on appeal is whether the landmark commission or city plan commission erred in evaluating the significance of the property based on the characteristics listed in Section 51A-4.501(b).  Appeal to the city council constitutes the final administrative remedy."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_3_4","(4)   Enforcement.  Upon initiation of the historic designation procedure, the historic preservation officer shall immediately notify the building official.  The building official shall not accept any application for a permit to alter, demolish, or remove the structure or site subject to the predesignation moratorium, unless a predesignation certificate of appropriateness or certificate for demolition or removal has been issued."

Unless there are specific provisions for the interior, the preservation criteria in the historic overlay district ordinance and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Rehabilitation of Historic Properties apply only to the exterior of structures within a historic overlay district."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_5_4","(4)   The landmark commission shall consider the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Rehabilitation of Historic Properties (“the Standards”), as amended, when reviewing applications for predesignation and standard certificates of appropriateness. Rehabilitation is defined as the act or process of making possible a compatible use for a property through repair, alterations, and additions while preserving those portions or features which convey its historical, cultural, or architectural values. The Standards are common sense principles in non-technical language developed to help promote consistent rehabilitation practices. It should be understood that the Standards are a series of concepts about maintaining, repairing, and replacing historic materials, as well as designing new additions or making alterations; as such, they cannot, in and of themselves, be used to make essential decisions about which features of a historic property should be saved and which might be changed. The director shall make the current Standards available for public inspection at all times. For informational purposes, the Standards published at Section 68.3 of Title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations (current through January 1, 2001) are set forth below:"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_5_4_1","(A)   A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new use that requires minimal changes to its distinctive materials, features, spaces and spatial relationships."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_5_4_2","(B)   The historic character of a property will be retained and preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features, spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_5_4_3","(C)   Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other historic properties, will not be undertaken."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_5_4_4","(D)   Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance in their own right will be retained and preserved."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_5_4_5","(E)   Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be preserved."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_5_4_6","(F)   Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_5_4_7","(G)   Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to historic materials will not be used."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_5_4_8","(H)   Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be undertaken."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_5_4_9","(I)   New  additions,  exterior alterations, or related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its environment."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_5_4_10","(J)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired."

For an application of no economically viable use of the property, the landmark commission shall cause to be established an ad hoc three-person economic review panel. The economic review panel must be comprised of three independent experts knowledgeable in the economics of real estate, renovation, and redevelopment. “Independent” as used in this subparagraph means that the expert has no financial interest in the property, its renovation, or redevelopment; is not an employee of the property owner; is not a city employee; is not a member of the landmark commission; and is not compensated for serving on the economic review panel. The economic review panel must consist of one person selected by the landmark commission, one person selected by the property owner, and one person selected by the first two appointees. If the first two appointees cannot agree on a third appointee within 30 days after submission of the documentation supporting the application, the third appointee will be selected by the director within 5 days. Within 35 days after submission of the documentation supporting the application, all appointments to the economic review panel shall be made. Within 35 days after appointment, the economic review panel shall review the submitted documentation; hold a public hearing; consider all options for renovation, adaptive reuse, and redevelopment; and forward a written recommendation to the landmark commission. The historic preservation officer shall provide administrative support to the economic review panel. The economic review panel’s recommendation must be based on the same standard for approval to be used by the landmark commission. An application of no economically viable use will not be considered complete until the economic review panel has made its recommendation to the landmark commission. If the economic review panel is unable to reach a consensus, the report will indicate the majority and minority recommendations."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_3_2","(B)   Within 65 days after submission of a complete application, the landmark commission shall hold a public hearing and shall approve or deny the application. If the landmark commission does not make a final decision within that time, the building official shall issue a permit to allow the requested demolition or removal. The property owner has the burden of proof to establish by clear and convincing evidence the necessary facts to warrant favorable action by the landmark commission."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4","(4)   Standard for approval.  The landmark commission shall deny the application unless it makes the following findings:"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_1","(A)   The landmark commission must deny an application to replace a structure with a new structure unless it finds that:"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_1_1","(i)   the new structure is more appropriate and compatible with the historic overlay district than the structure to be demolished or removed; and"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_1_2","(ii)   the owner has the financial ability and intent to build the new structure. The landmark commission must first approve the predesignation certificate of appropriateness or certificate of appropriateness for the proposed new structure and the guarantee agreement to construct the new structure before it may consider the application to demolish or remove."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_2","(B)   The landmark commission must deny an application of no economically viable use of the property unless it finds that:"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_2_1","(i)   the structure is incapable of earning a reasonable economic return unless the demolition or removal is allowed (a reasonable economic return does not have to be the most profitable return possible);"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_2_2","(ii)   the structure cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by the owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a reasonable economic return; and"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_2_3","(iii)   the owner has failed during the last two years to find a developer, financier, purchaser, or tenant that would enable the owner to realize a reasonable economic return, despite having made substantial ongoing efforts to do so."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_3","(C)   The landmark commission must deny an application to demolish or remove a structure that poses an imminent threat to public health or safety unless it finds that:"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_3_1","(i)   the structure constitutes a documented major and imminent threat to public health and safety;"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_3_2","(ii)   the demolition or removal is required to alleviate the threat to public health and safety; and"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_3_3","(iii)   there is no reasonable way, other than demolition or removal, to eliminate the threat in a timely manner."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_4","(D)   The landmark commission must deny an application to demolish or remove a structure that is noncontributing to the historic overlay district because it is newer than the period of historic significance unless it finds that:"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_4_1","(i)   the  structure  is non-contributing to the historic overlay district;"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_4_2","(ii)   the structure is newer than the period of historic significance for the historic overlay district; and"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_4_4_3","(iii)   demolition of the structure will not adversely affect the historic character of the property or the integrity of the historic overlay district."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_5","(5)   Appeal. The chair of the landmark commission shall give verbal notice of the right to appeal at the time a decision on the application is made. If the applicant is not present at the hearing, the director shall inform the applicant of the right to appeal in writing within 10 days after the hearing. Any interested person may appeal the decision of the landmark commission to the city plan commission by filing a written notice with the director within 30 days after the date of the decision of the landmark commission. If no appeal is made of a decision to approve the certificate for demolition or removal within the 30-day period, the building official shall issue the permit to allow demolition or removal. If an appeal is filed, the city plan commission shall hear and decide the appeal within 65 days after the date of its filing. The director shall forward to the city plan commission a complete record of the matter being appealed, including a transcript of the tape of the hearing before the landmark commission. In considering an appeal, the city plan commission shall review the landmark commission record and hear and consider arguments from the appellant and the representative for the landmark commission. The city plan commission may only hear new testimony or consider new evidence that was not presented at the time of the hearing before the landmark commission to determine whether that testimony or evidence was available at the landmark commission hearing. If the city plan commission determines that new testimony or evidence exists that was not available at the landmark commission hearing, the city plan commission shall remand the case back to the landmark commission in accordance with Subsection (o). In reviewing the landmark commission decision the city plan commission shall use the substantial evidence standard in Subsection (o). The city plan commission may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, modify the decision of the landmark commission, or remand any case back to the landmark commission for further proceedings. Appeal to the city plan commission constitutes the final administrative remedy."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_6","(6)   Reapplication.  If a final decision is reached denying a certificate for demolition or removal, no further applications may be considered for the subject matter of the denied certificate for demolition or removal for one year from the date of the final decision unless:"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_6_1","(A)   the certificate for demolition or removal has been denied without prejudice; or"
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_6_2","(B)   the landmark commission waives the time limitation because the landmark commission finds that there are changed circumstances sufficient to warrant a new hearing. A simple majority vote by the landmark commission is required to grant the request for waiver of the time limitation."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_8_7","(7)   Expiration.  A certificate for demolition or removal expires if the work authorized by the certificate for demolition or removal is not commenced within 180 days from the date of the certificate for demolition or removal. The director may extend the time for commencement of work upon written request by the applicant showing circumstances beyond the control of the applicant. If the certificate for demolition or removal expires, a new certificate for demolition or removal must first be obtained before the work can be commenced."

Therefore, the procedures in this subsection seek to preserve historic structures while eliminating urban nuisances."
"SEC. 51A-4.501_9_2","(2)   Notice to landmark commission by email.

"SEC. 51A-4.702_1_6_3","(C)   Some provisions of Chapter 51 have been amended to refer to the parallel provisions in Chapter 51A. This type of amendment has been made to every extent possible in order to make interpretation and application of the code more consistent and simpler. The amendment process is referred to as “call-forwarding the provisions of Chapter 51” because the amendment incorporates by reference into Chapter 51 the corresponding language in Chapter 51A as it exists on the date of amendment and as it may be amended in the future. The following apply when interpreting call-forwarded provisions of Chapter 51 for planned development districts created under Chapter 51 of the Dallas City Code."
"SEC. 51A-4.702_1_6_3_1","(i)   If a call-forwarded provision contains a cross-reference in Chapter 51A to another section in Chapter 51A, the cross-reference should be read to apply to the parallel provisions in Chapter 51."
"SEC. 51A-4.702_1_6_3_1_1","--   For example, the sexually oriented business regulations in Section 51-4.221 have been call-forwarded. Within those regulations, there is a reference to Section 51A-4.217, the accessory use regulations in Chapter 51A. When applying these regulations to a Chapter 51 planned development district, reference should be made to Section 51-4.217, the accessory use regulations in Chapter 51."
"SEC. 51A-4.702_1_6_3_1_2","--   Similarly, Section 51-4.324 has been call-forwarded. Section 51-4.324(b)(1) refers to “residential districts.” The definition of “residential districts” is located in Section 51A-2.102(119), but the definition makes reference to only Chapter 51A districts. When applying Section 51A-4.324(b)(1) to a Chapter 51 planned development district, reference should be made to the definition of “residential districts” in Chapter 51, which is provided in Section 51-2.102(104)."
"SEC. 51A-4.702_1_6_3_1_2_1","The building official shall determine the parallel provision in Chapter 51 when applying a call-forwarded regulation."
"SEC. 51A-4.702_1_6_3_2","(ii)   If a call-forwarded provision contains a reference to “this chapter,” Chapter 51 should also be included in its application. If a call-forwarded provision contains a reference to “this section” or another internal cross reference, and the regulation referenced has not been call-forwarded, the parallel provision in Chapter 51 applies. The building official shall determine the parallel cross-reference in Chapter 51 when applying a call-forwarded regulation."
"SEC. 51A-4.702_1_6_3_3","(iii)   If a district category is referenced in a call-forwarded provision, that district category, as defined in Chapter 51, should be included in the application of the regulation. For example, if a regulation has been call-forwarded, and the corresponding regulation in Chapter 51A applies to “industrial districts,” the regulation applies to the Industrial-1, Industrial-2, and Industrial-3 districts when applied to a Chapter 51 planned development district. The building official shall determine the parallel district category in Chapter 51 when applying a call-forwarded regulation."
"SEC. 51A-4.702_1_6_3_4","(iv)   If a use category is referenced in a call-forwarded provision, that use category, as defined in Chapter 51, should be included in the application of the regulation. For example, if a regulation has been call-forwarded, and the corresponding regulation in Chapter 51A applies to “transportation uses,” the regulation also applies to the transportation uses contained in Chapter 51 when applied to a Chapter 51 planned development district. The building official shall determine the parallel use category in Chapter 51 when applying a call-forwarded regulation."
"SEC. 51A-4.702_1_6_3_5","(v)   The general guidelines below control if a provision of Chapter 51 has been call-forwarded to the parallel provision in Chapter 51A, and the regulation in Chapter 51A refers only to a Chapter 51A zoning classification in its application."

"SEC. 51A-4.803_6_3_2","(B)   development of the lot will create a soil or drainage problem which can be avoided or substantially mitigated by reasonable modifications in the plan;"

All prospective tenants of an SAH unit must agree to provide or to allow the director to obtain sufficient information to enable income verification as contemplated in this subsection as a condition to leasing the unit. A person commits an offense if he or she, with the intent to lease or occupy an SAH unit, misrepresents the gross annual family income of its tenant or prospective tenant to the lessor or the city of Dallas with knowledge of its  falsity.

The amount of the payment required is calculated by multiplying the cost of constructing the multifamily dwelling unit [See Paragraph (2) below] required by the number of units of that size that will not be required by reason of the payment. The entire payment must be made to the director before issuance of any required permit."

"SEC. 51A-4.910_2","(b)   Provision of single family uses.  It is assumed that all SAH units provided will be multifamily uses. A property owner may, however, reduce the number of SAH units required to obtain a density bonus by providing one or more single family uses as SAH units in accordance with this subsection and Sections 51A-4.901 through 51A-4.909.

First, determine the number of each size of single family use provided. (For example, a person may provide two two-bedroom and three four-bedroom single family uses as SAH units.) Then, multiply the number of each size of single family use provided by the number of multifamily bedrooms that will not be required by reason of the provision of those single family uses. Next, add these numbers to determine the total number of multifamily bedrooms that will not be required. (In the above example, 21 multifamily bedrooms would not be required because of the provision of the single family uses.) This number is then subtracted from the total number of bedrooms of SAH units that would otherwise be required by Section 51A-4.906(b)(4) to obtain the density bonus. The result is then broken down into the number of different sizes of SAH units required by Section 51A-4.906(b)(4) to obtain the density bonus.  (Ord. 21663)"
