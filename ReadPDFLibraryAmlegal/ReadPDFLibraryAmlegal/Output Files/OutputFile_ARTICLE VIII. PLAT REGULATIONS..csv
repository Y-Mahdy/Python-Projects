Dedications shown on plats are irrevocable offers to dedicate the property shown. Once the offer to dedicate is made, it may be accepted by an action by the city council, by acceptance of the improvements in the dedicated areas for the purposes intended, or by actual use by the city.

Drainage systems constructed downstream must be designed for a 100-year storm of the drainage basin without taking into consideration the reduction in flow provided by the detention facility upstream, unless a lesser criteria is approved by the director of water utilities when the proposed development does not increase the stormwater drainage from the property and the director determines that the drainage system is not necessary to preserve public health or safety."
"SEC. 51A-8.611_3_7","(7)   Storm water runoff from any plat into a contiguous city may be required to comply with the criteria of the contiguous city as directed by the director of sustainable development and construction provided there is a written agreement in effect at the time."
"SEC. 51A-8.611_3_8","(8)   The dual outlet control is not required in the design of the detention basin when the proposed outfall is onto an erosion protected surface that is no less than 100 feet from the outfall."
"SEC. 51A-8.611_3_9","(9)   When development of the property downstream results in the construction of facilities designed to accommodate the 100- year storm, and the detention facilities upstream are no longer necessary, the detention facilities may be abandoned and the land reclaimed for other purposes."
"SEC. 51A-8.611_4","(d)   Floodways."
"SEC. 51A-8.611_4_1","(1)   Generally.
